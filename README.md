# CP1404 Assignment: Reading List by Yaroslav Gnatenko
Assignment Details:
This project is the modified version of Assignment 1 but it is implemented on the app.kv file instead of python file.
In terms of how the program works, the "Required Books" shows the buttons for the Required Books list,
and at the same time the button has the background color depending whether the book object is long or not
(500 pages at least). In terms of functionality of the button, when the button on the required book object is clicked,
the button will mark the book as completed, which makes the button disappeared and moved to the completed books button
list. In terms of the how "Completed Books" button works, the button shows the buttons for the Completed Books list and
when the completed button object is clicked, it shows the description of the Book object(return value of the class).
On the other one, "Add Button" button occurs when the inputs in the text fields are reasonable, which shows the error
messages when the inputs in the text fields shows otherwise, which involves the incomplete fields, negative number of
pages and different types of input in pages input. In the "Clear" button, the button is used for clearing all
the inputs in the text fields.

_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get full marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
Technically, it took around 1 week to complete it, because I was busy with other assignments too.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
Its not my first time in Programming 1 class, so Iam quite fam with this.The previous practicals helps me a lot.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
There were many assignments before, which makes me to have less time to do so.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The kv application to create buttons based on the required and completed books list, and the referencing on the booklists.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I should be more prepared, which is plan to do for the programming more properly. Besides, I should have studied more properly in order to understand the behaviour of the program. Hopefully, I will be more patient.

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
The resources that I used is the previous practicals and Internet.In terms of how I used them, I used them to understand about how program works, to understand better about the class and kv, and to gain knowledge about them. I watched some video lessons too.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
Throughout the process, there are errors with unknown cause, which makes me to search for the code that force me to try different ways to solve the problem. For the problem solving, I tried to rest in order to get my mood to do the assignment back other than searching the resources, which makes me more productive to solve the problem.
